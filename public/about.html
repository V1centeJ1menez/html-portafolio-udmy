<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I'm Vicente Jiménez, a third-year Computer Engineering student at Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, starting in semester 2025-1. I'm passionate about software development, computer science, and how technology shapes the future.
  
  Currently, I'm working on **LocalStack**, a web platform designed to centralize academic resources for various subjects in my career, offering theory, visualizations, and tools to help students like me succeed.
  
  Beyond programming, I enjoy exploring the intersection of physics and technology, always seeking innovative ways to apply scientific principles in real-world solutions. 
  
  Feel free to connect with me and explore my journey in engineering and tech!
